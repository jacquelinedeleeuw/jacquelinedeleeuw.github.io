            <p>I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in the hospitality and food & beverage industry.</p>
            <p>My interest in coding began after starting a business with friends and taking on the challenge to create our own website instead of outsourcing. With the use of Wordpress I created my first website. As I am a very curious person, always looking to develop and grow, I realised there must be a way to enhance this. </p>
            <p>After some time learning online, I decided to fast track my learning by enrolling in a Software Engineering Immersive course.</p>
            <p>My previous experience has given me a lot of patience, I donâ€™t believe in too difficult or impossible and see any challenge as an opportunity to improve.  </p>
            <p>I enjoy working in an environment where I can share my experience and skills as well as learn from others, while always delivering the best possible result.</p>
