              <p className="mb-0">I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in the hospitality and food & beverage industry.
                <br /><br />My interest in coding began after starting a business with friends and taking on the challenge to create our own website instead of outsourcing. With the use of Wordpress I created my first website. As I am a very curious person, always looking to develop and grow, I realised there must be a way to enhance this. After some time learning online, I decided to fast track my learning by enrolling in a Software Engineering Immersive course.
                <br /><br />My previous experience has given me a lot of patience, I donâ€™t believe in too difficult or impossible and see any challenge as an opportunity to improve. I enjoy working in an environment where I can share my experience and skills as well as learn from others, while always delivering the best possible result.
